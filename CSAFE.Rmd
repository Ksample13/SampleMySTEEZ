## Kahlil Sample

*Kahlil has attended many schools during his lifetime and has met a variety of people as a result of living in the military household. While attending **Albany State University** he has learned the chemical name for NaCl~2~. His favorite chemical compound is ~~H~2~ SO~4~~~. One may visit the school's website at <http://www.asurams.edu> *

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
